# Chain-node
CRD and operator designed to achieve CITA-Cloud cloud native

## Background
- Cita-Cloud can develop solutions based on the alliance chain for enterprise scenarios, and directly deliver the chain as a service object to the end, avoiding various problems encountered by current enterprises using the alliance chain.
- The "Alliance chain + cloud native" solution can reuse the cloud native software stack, which will be closer to enterprise applications, and is superior to traditional alliance chain solutions in terms of ease of use. If the enterprise already uses Kubernetes, it can greatly reduce the switching cost of the enterprise.
